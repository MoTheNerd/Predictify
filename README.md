## Predicitfy

# Inspiration
N/A - The hackathon's theme didn't sufficiently match with my personal interests so this was kind of just force-pumped out
# What it does
It's got a nice UI I guess. There's a lot more that's missing but oh well.
# How I built it
On a lot of coffee lmao
# Challenges I ran into
everything
# Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Damn, that UI tho and that firebase integration 10/10
# What I learned
I should sleep more during these things.
# What's next for Predictify
Finish it off - once I have more sleep and perhaps submit it on the app store
# FINAL NOTE
cannot upload to devpost, check github (zip file too large)
